= MK2 Bot from the 2015-10-01 Scalatron Hackathon in Warsaw

== Introduction

This is code for a bot created with https://github.com/michalkarolik[Micha≈Ç] during the http://www.meetup.com/WarszawScaLa/events/219296749["Scalatron na Narodowym w JAVEO" Hackatron].

It's a simple bot that mostly implements simple "bad-avoidance, good-following" with a twist (see <<Notes>>).
Instead of focusing on the AI we've decided to work on the code structure instead, working towards something akin
 to a nice https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system[entity-component-system]
 footnote:[This is our official version on why we were only 13/21 in the tourney, and we're sticking with it.].

== Notes

* This is a very rudimentary SBT project, with no automated deploy tasks. We've looked over http://jmhofer.johoop.de/?p=292[a couple]
http://jmhofer.johoop.de/?p=292[of various] SBT definition templates, but none seem to be really complete (and completely working
with all version of Scalatron).
* We partially based the project on the "Reference bot", but only used the utility classes (`XY`, `Direction`, `View` etc.), and
 further modified them for our needs. The logic itself is built from the ground up.
* **This is not the same code as the one used in the tournament.** In particular, it adds a rather nasty feature
 footnote:[That was completed too late, some 20 minutes after the tourney's start.] that aggressively tries to monopolize
 all available resources by mass spawning, recursive minibots. Kills the reference bot (and the CPU) a treat. **If you
  want to test the bot in the "tournament version", remove the spawning logic in `normalBehavior()`**.
* No, the code is not very clean ;).
* Believe it or not, the logic is deliberately simple. In a tournament of this type, it looks like the situation is so chaotic
that it pays to just keep focusing on the local situation, instead of focusing on elaborate globalized solution that may
be actually fare worse than a pure random-walk footnote:[For example, it became evident that
https://github.com/scalatron/scalatron/blob/master/Scalatron/doc/markdown/Scalatron%20Game%20Rules.md#the-entity-types[Fluppets]
  were hearded towards the bot anyway, running away from the others.].
